    "This might seem like a strange way of doing things at first, but we will see that it is actually a very convenient way of reading files and often considered a best practice. This way of reading a file is known as a reading a file with a context manager. We will learn about context managers more generally later on in this path.\n",

    "As with a *for* loop, the code that wants to access the *file* variable should be indented within the *with* statment, as shown in the example. Once we leave the *with* body, the file will be automatically closed. We can see whether a file is closed or not by accessing the *file.closed*\n",

    "In general it is more convenient to work with UTF-8 files since very often this is the default encoding used by Python. We learned in the previous mission that UTF-16 might save us some space when compared to UTF-8 when we are dealing with non-European languages. However in this case the amount of non-European data is minimal so it does not really matter.\n",

    "3) Open the new file using the desired encoding\n",

    "In this section I'm going learn how much space Python objects use in memory. We will also learn how other programming languages represent some of the most common data types such as integers. Python is actually quite different from most other languages in this regard. However, even though we will mostly program in Python, this knowledge will prove helpful when you learn about databases.\n",

    "To represent positive and negative numbers using a fixed number of bits the two's complement representation was invented. This representation works in the same way as we have learned before with a single difference. The leftmost bit has value $−2^{n − 1}$ rather than $2^{n −1}$, where n is the number of bits used.\n"
