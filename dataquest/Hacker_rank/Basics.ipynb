    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/ \"Y combinator\"), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News listing can get hundreds of thousands of vistors as a result.\n",

Below are descriptions of the columns: \n",
    "- **id**:The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- **title**:The title of the post \n",
    "- **url**: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "- **num_points**: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- **num_comments**: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- **author**: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- **author**: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
