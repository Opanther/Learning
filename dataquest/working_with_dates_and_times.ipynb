    " In Python, a module is simply a collection of variables, functions, and/or classes (which we'll collectively call 'definitions') that can be imported into a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python contains many standard modules that help us perform various tasks, such as performing advanced mathematical operations, working with specific file formats and databases, and working with dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we use definitions from a module, we first need to import those definitions. There are a number of ways we can import modules and their definitions using the import statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the whole module by name**. This is the most common method for importing module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import the module \n",
    "import csv \n",
    "\n",
    "# definitions are available using the format\n",
    "# module_name.definition_name\n",
    "csv.reader()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import the whole module with an alias**. This is especially useful if a module is long and we need to type t a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# import the module with an alias\n",
    "import csv as c\n",
    "\n",
    "# definitions are available using the format\n",
    "# alias.definition_name\n",
    "c.reader()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **import one or more definition from the module by name**. This technique eis useful if you want only a single or select definition and don't want to import everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import a single definition\n",
    "from csv import reader\n",
    "\n",
    "# the definition you imported is available\n",
    "# by name\n",
    "reader()\n",
    "\n",
    "# import multiple definitions\n",
    "from csv import reader, writer\n",
    "\n",
    "# the definitions you imported are available\n",
    "# using the format definition_name\n",
    "reader()\n",
    "writer()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import all definitions with a wildcard.** This is udeful if you want to import and use many definitions from a module. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import all definitions\n",
    "from csv import *\n",
    "\n",
    "# all definitions from the module are\n",
    "# available using the format definition_name\n",
    "reader()\n",
    "writer()\n",
    "get_dialect()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has three standard modules that are designed to help working with dates and times: \n",
    "- The **calendar** module \n",
    "- The **time** module \n",
    "- The **datetime** module \n",
    "\n",
    "While each module has a particular area of focus, there is a lot of crossover functionality. The most useful module for working with data â€” and the module we'll learn about is the *dateime module*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "date_format = \"%m/%d/%y %H:%M\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ref for when i use a for loop to iterate over each row in a data list of lists\n",
    "for row in potus: \n",
    "    start_date = row[2]\n",
    "    start_date = dt.datetime.strptime(start_date, date_format)\n",
